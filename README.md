# ios-inshorts-view
This is a UI component, written in Objective-C, that can be used for implementing a vertical swipe up-down view for next/previous cards, just like the News Inshorts App, in a iOS application.

## How to use this component?
1. Copy the files **InshortsView.h** and **InshortsView.m** into your Xcode project.
2. In your view controller code, **#import "InshortsView.h"** and implement the protocols **InshortsViewDelegate** and **InshortsViewDataSource**.
3. Check the **InshortsTest** demo application for more details on the usage.
